Rags to Riches
Rags to Riches can be a single or two player game involving cards and dice.

How to play:
The user will be asked how many people (1 or 2) will be playing the game. If it is 1 then the player will play agaist a bot and if there are 2 people then those two people will play against each other. After that the players will be asked what score they would like to play to. Then they will be asked how many sides they would like their die to be when playing. You will input names if the players and then the games starts. The wound will be presented and the users names with their points. It will show what card the user has selected. The cards are like blackjack with set values and that allows you to have so many turns per round. The user will then decide to roll or end the turn. If you roll then two die will randomly roll and the combined numbers from the die will be you score. You then can either roll again if you have another turn to get more points added on or you can end your current turn. If you roll again and if one of the die rolls a 1 then you lose your points for that round and the turn automatically ends. And if you role two 1's then you lose all your points in the game. When you typed end then your turn ends and the points you have scored already will be saved. The more rolls you do the more of a risk you have to lose points. This will alternate between the two users or the user and the bot until someone reaches the score tha was decided on at the beginning of the game.
